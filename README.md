# Rules: 

## Don't make any changes to HTML file directly. Only write JavaScript code to do the following below:
1. Change the color of the h1 text to red through JavaScript when the page loads
2. If user clicks on button with text "Click me to change text to green", change the text of h1 tag toâ€¨green.
3. If user clicks on button with text "Click me to change text to blue", change the text of h1 tag to blue.
4. Create a paragraph tag with the text "Footer Text" and add it as the last element INSIDE of the DIV with the ID of section.
5. If user clicks on button with text "I don't have a class or ID", then create an alert to the user saying "I don't have a class or ID"
6. If user clicks on the button with text "Click to enlarge buttons to the left", then add the class of "btn-Ig" to the 2 buttons on the left of it. Accomplish this by creating a loop and adding the class to the buttons with a loop.
